# Overview of Web and Cloud Development

Let’s review the basics of how you interact with a website.

1. You launch an internet browser – there are lots available:
- Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari are some of the most popular.
2. The browser has an address bar, into which you enter a URL, like www.IBM.com.
3. The browser then contacts the server with the name and requests the information that
makes up the website.
- For most websites, the server will return:
HTML, which defines the structure of the page, but doesn’t look very attractive
- CSS, which adds style and flair to the page and 
- JavaScript, which adds interactivity and
dynamic content.

## 2 type of content display by website
1. <b>static:</b> generated each time they are requested by the client
2. <b>dynamic:</b>  elements can involve information coming from other systems and applications, such
as databases.

## Cloud applications
- Cloud Apps are built to work seamlessly with a Cloud-based back-end infrastructure
- Cloud-based
data storage and data processing, and other Cloud services, making them very scalable
and very resilient.

## 3 area of cloud applications
1. <b>Frontend:</b> The front-end deals with everything that happens at the client-side
- specialize in front-end coding, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related
frameworks, libraries, and tools.

2. <b>Backend:</b> Deal with the server before the code and data are sent to client
- handles the logic and functionality that make the website or
app work, and the authentication processes that keep data secure.
- Back-end developers may also work with relational or noSQL databases, even collaborating with

3. <b>Full Stack</b> : have skills, knowledge, and experience in both front-end and back-end
environments.

## Recap
In this brief overview, you learned about:
- The basic communication between client and servers.
- How websites are built and displayed.
- Front-end development is about what happens on the client side.
- Back-end development is about what happens on the server.
- Full-stack development incudes both front-end and back-end development.
- IDEs will help you create and manage your code.
