## CI CD 
CI/CD refers to the practices of continuous integration and either continuous delivery
or continuous deployment.

### CI 
A CI build environment enables you to integrate newly developed code frequently, at least
every day, if not every hour, depending on how quickly the project changes.

### CD 
Continuous delivery (CD) begins where CI ends. The CI process automatically builds and tests
your code, then CD deploys all code changes in a build to a testing or staging environment.

- enabling developers to deliver frequent changes
- Implemented through a build-automation server
- CI automaticlly builds and test code
- CD deplys the changes


## Build Tools
Transform source code into binaries for installation

- Important in environment with many inter-connected projects
and multiple developers

- Automate tasks like:
    - Downloading dependencies 
    - Complieing source code into binary code
    - Packaging that binary code 
    - Running tests
    - Deplyment to production systems

- initiate a build from the command line or from an IDE.
- Two categories that are widly used:
    - Build-autoation utilites 
    - Build-automation services

### here are some examples 
    - Webpack is module bundler for JavaScript
    - Babel is JavaScript compiler
    - Web Assembly - a binary instruction format that runs in your browser

## Packages
- Packages make appss easy to install 
- Packages contain
    - App files 
    - Instructions for installation
    - Metadata
## Package Manager
- Makes working with packages easier
- Coordinate with file archivers to extract packge archivers
- Verify checksums and digital certificates to ensure the integrity and authenticity of
the package.
- Locate, download, install, or update existing software from a software repository.
- manage dependencies to ensure a package is installed with all packages it requires.

### Here are some commons
1. On Linux
    - Debian Package Management System (DPKG). 
    - Red Hat Package Manager (RPM).
2. On Window
    - Chocolatey
3. On Android 
    - Package Manager
4. On MacOS
    - Homebrew 
    - MacPorts

### Cloud application package Manager
- Libraries and utility code are managed with the cloud application package managers
