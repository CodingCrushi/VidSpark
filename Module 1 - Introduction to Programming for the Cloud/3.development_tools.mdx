A cloud application developer’s workbench includes:
## Version Control 
- systems keep track of what changes were made when and by whom and resolve
- Provide  a way to revert to an older version like Git and GitHub
any conflicts between changes.

## Libraries
- Collection of code, like standard programs and subroutines, that you can use
within your code.
- Multiple code libraries can be integrated into your existing project.
- Code can be called when required
- Can solve specific problem or add specific feature
### here are some examples 
<b>jQuery</b> is a JavaScript library that simplifies Dom manipulation.
<b>Email-validator</b> is a small library that checks an email address is correctly constructed
and valid.
<b>Apache</b> Commons Proper is a repository of reusable Java components.

## Frameworks.
- provide a standard way to build and deploy applications.
- Act as skeleton that you can extend by adding your own code,
- should be determind and used from the beginning
- New frameworks can’t be incorporated into an existing project.
- dictates the architecture of your program
-  Calls on your code
- Allow you less control than libaraies

### examples
- AngularJS is a JavaScript-based framework for dynamic web applications.
- Vue.js is a JavaScript framework focused on the user interface.
- Django is a framework that uses Python for web development.

## Inversion of control
- libaraies allow you to call function as and when required
- Framworks define the workflow that you must follow
- Inversion of control makes the framwork extensible
